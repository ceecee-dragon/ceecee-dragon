  I'm a library information science (LIS) major at Drexel. I'm a teacher/librarian at a K-8 elementary school. I feel like that's a great summary and reason for everything that happens to me. My interests.... vast. Very vast. Yep. that's about it.

I had some interest in [digital preservation and found the link to the right] (https://github.com/ruarxive/awesome-digital-preservation)
I have an interest in diital preservation - as well as digital repositories - because I'm currently fixing up a remodeled bathroom into a library fit for k-8 students. While the library is not functional I do want students to have access to materials so digital items was something I was looking into. 
I had some interest in library collection management and instead found [this gem] (https://github.com/paulveillard/cybersecurity-incident-response) which is about something I do care about since I'm also in the business of risk management.
